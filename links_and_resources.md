## Books

Many of these are old but are still very good

- _Elements of Programming with Perl_ by Andrew L Johnson (Manning, 1999)
A golden oldie and the first Perl book I read and still one of my favourite books on programming

- _Minimal Perl_ by Tim Maher (Manning 2006)
Used as the title of this repo so that says something about what I think of it. Excellent for Perl and UNIX.
Also somewhat dated but don't let that put you off

- _Higher Order Perl_ by Mark J Dominus (Morgan Kaufmann, 2005)
A really great book on _functional programming_ in Perl and another of my all-time _programming_ favourites.
What's more, there's a [free version!](https://hop.perl.plover.com)

- Perl Best Practices by Damian Conway (O'Reilly, 2005)
Dated bu still full of excellent advice on how to write good code. All his books are excellent and he's worth
checking out on youtube

For more up-to-date books on Perl:

- _Modern Perl_ 4th edition by Chromatic (Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2016)
Excellent book and available for free!

- _Beginning Perl_ by Curtis Poe (Wrox Programmer to Programmer, 2012)
I have only read parts of this but those parts were good

- _Learning Perl_ by  Randal L. Schwartz, brian d foy and Tom Phoenix (O'Reilly, 2021)
The best place to start for programming rookies

## Internet

- [Steve's Place](http://www.resoo.org/docs/perl/perl_tutorial/lesson01.html)
I started with this one many years ago. The Perl syntax is dated in places but it is still a good resource

I found this one recently, it looks very good
- [Perl one-liners cookbook](https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/cover.html)
