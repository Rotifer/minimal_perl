# README 

Notes and code examples that might be of interest to anyone who uses the unix command line and its extensive suite of tools.
Perl can be an extremely effective tool in this setting. Perl is much better than its many critics would have you believe
If you're using a unix-type system (OS X, any linux distro), the chances are that Perl and many Perl modules are already installed and 
ready for use so why not take advantage and give it a try if you haven't used it before.

## Notes

- This repo contains codes and notes on Perl scripting in a Unix type environment.
- It draws heavily on the book _Minimal Perl_ by Tim Maher (Manning, 2006).
- The notes and code are devoted to using Perl for command line scripting in conjunction with shell and Unix tools
- The code here was developed on a Mac Book Pro
- It also runs on Ubuntu 20.04
- The objective is to rely as much as possible on core Perl modules that ship with the standard Perl distribution and on Unix tools that are shipped as standard or that can be easily installed

## Assumptions

For anyone reading the notes or the code, the following is assumed:

- Basic Unix knowledge
- Able to program in some language, perhaps shell but not necessarily Perl

## Not covered

- Though some of the external modules described and used here may be object oriented (OO), none of the examples I give are written in the OO style
- Nothing on webpages or GUIs, it's command line all the way here
- Nothing about Perl 6/Raku. I haven't used Raku yet so cannot comment
- Perl 7 - most of the examples here should run in Perl 7 when it is released
